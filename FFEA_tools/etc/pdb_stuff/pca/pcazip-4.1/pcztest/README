Test of pcazip utilities.

Run:
./test.sh >& test.log

and then diff test.log with compare.log

Expect the odd difference in the last dp for a few numbers, and messages
from the molfile-substitute routines differ from those provided by the
genuine article.

**NOTE**
If you get 'segmentation violation' errors, you may have a memory
problem - try issuing the command:

$ limit stacksize unlimited

before you run.
