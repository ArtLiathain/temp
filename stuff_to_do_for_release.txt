Write stuff in here that needs to be done for release. Delete when completed. When empty...have crazy party!

 * [PyMOL] Make the plugin able to deal with default parameters 
           in same way as the core code

 * [PyMOL] add a text box in the plugin to assign a name to the system 
           that will be loaded, instead of the "blob" name that is 
           currently hardcoded.

 * Energy recording - we need to record the energy of the system, and
           split it into the different components, Steric, LJ, Springs,
           PreComputed potentials, kinetic ...

 * Center of mass movement removal - check the Flying_ice_cube effect.
                  rotation too?

 * [PreComp] deal with multiple conformations

 * [Doc] - visualisation and other tools
         - finish the tutorial

 * [CMake] - zip the PyMOL plugin.

 * [Tests] - add a number of tests, to ensure that changes have not 
           broken anything.

 * [OMP] - ensure that the RNG seeds are correct.

 * [Tools] - print out ".nodes" coordinate files for a given snapshot.

 * [Compiler] - fix warnings for most of the compilers.
