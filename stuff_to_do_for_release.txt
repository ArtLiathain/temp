Write stuff in here that needs to be done for release. Delete when completed. When empty...have crazy party!

 * [PyMOL] Make the plugin able to deal with default parameters 
           in same way as the core code

 * Energy recording - we need to record the energy of the system, and
           split it into the different components, Steric, LJ, Springs,
           PreComputed potentials, kinetic ...
           Make sure it is thread safe. 

 * [Springs] Springs should ideally be set up as a spring solver, to bring it
	     in line with the other global things

 * [PreComp] deal with multiple conformations

 * [Doc] - visualisation and other tools
         - finish the tutorial

 * [Tests] - add a number of tests, to ensure that changes have not 
           broken anything.

 * [Comments] - finish translating comments into Doxygen comments. 

 * [PRNG] - save the state of the RNG after finishing a simulation, and 
            restore this state on a restarted simulation.
