Write stuff in here that needs to be done for release. Delete when completed. When empty...have crazy party!

 * [PyMOL] Make the plugin able to deal with default parameters 
           in same way as the core code

 * [Doc] - document the python tools and the modules 



# The following will come with the next release:

 * [PreComp] deal with multiple conformations 

 * [Springs] Springs should ideally be set up as a spring solver, to bring it
	     in line with the other global things

 * [TimeStep Calculator] - Work out mechanical timesteps from forces... :(
