Write stuff in here that needs to be done for release. Delete when completed. When empty...have crazy party!

 * [PyMOL] Make the plugin able to deal with default parameters 
           in same way as the core code

 * Energy recording - we need to record the energy of the system, and
           split it into the different components, Steric, LJ, Springs,
           PreComputed potentials, kinetic ...
           Make sure it is thread safe. 

 * [Doc] - visualisation and other tools
         - finish the tutorial
         - document the python tools and the modules 

 * [Tests] - add a test using the precomputed potentials. A set of potentials
           have been added in tests/physics/ff-2x4beads/. 
           - one last test with the colliding balls could be added. 
           One would still to think on what to exactly check for that one.

 * [Comments] - finish translating comments into Doxygen comments.




# The following will come with the next release:

 * [PreComp] deal with multiple conformations 

 * [Springs] Springs should ideally be set up as a spring solver, to bring it
	     in line with the other global things

 * [TimeStep Calculator] - Work out mechanical timesteps from forces... :(
