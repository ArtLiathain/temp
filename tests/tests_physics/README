These are some simple tests that are designed to test the ffea code at an intermediate level - between that of a benchmark and unit test. These tests are designed to check that a mesh has been read in correclty and that it is handled correctly by the computational functions within the ffea codes.

All the tests are run by the run_tests.sh script. 

These tests are available in the installed software and the paths set within the script assume that the scripts are within the normal ffea file structure.

Currently these tests are not used and so probably do not work as the file formats have changed.
