These are some simple tests that are designed to test the ffea code at an high level - as opposed to unit tests.
  Description of the tests can be found in the FFEA software paper.

Tests can be run from the build folder sequentially typing "make test" or using a number of threads through "ctest -j <nthreads>".

These tests are not currently made available in the installed software.
