Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis models proteins as visco-elastic bodies subject to
 thermal fluctuations. Details on this approach can be found in this
 [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999112007589
         "A stochastic finite element model for the dynamics of globular proteins")

Additionally:

 * Specific interactions can be defined using precomputed potentials. Read the
    [documentation](\ref fmApproach) if you are interested in doing so.

 * Kinetic state changes can be simulated together with the continuum model to
    account for conformational changes and binding events. Read the
    [documentation](\ref kineticApproach) if you are interested in doing so.
