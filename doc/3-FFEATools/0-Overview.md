Overview {#FTOverview}
=========================


The FFEA tools is an independent python package that can be installed using the 
 python ` setup ` tools. Its API reference has been generated by Doxygen and can be 
 consulted. A tutorial showing most of its possibilities can be found in the 
 [FFEA main page](file:../../doc/html/index.html), 
 under the ` FFEA tools` chapter , in the [FFEA Analysis](file:../../doc/html/FFEAanalysistut.html) section. 
 More detailed documentation on this sub-package will be written soon.
