Overview {#FTOverview}
=========================


The FFEA tools is an independent python package that can be installed using the 
 python ` setup ` tools. Its API reference has been generated by Doxygen and can be 
 consulted. The same tutorial showing most of its possibilities can be found
 either in the 
 [FFEA main page](file:../../doc/html/index.html), 
 under the ` Tutorial` chapter , in the ` Analysis and FFEA tools ` section
 or [here](\ref FFEAanalysistut). 
 More detailed documentation on the API of this sub-package will be written soon.
