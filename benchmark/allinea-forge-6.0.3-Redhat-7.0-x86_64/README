1.  Installing Allinea Forge
============================

    Run the graphical "installer" or the text-only "textinstall.sh" from the download
    tarball.

    You may choose to install just for you or for all users on your system.
    If you are installing on a cluster, please make sure that it is
    available at the same path on every machine.

    If you have a job submission system such as PBS or LoadLeveller running
    then please see the User Guide for additional setup information.

    The Allinea Forge user guide in the doc directory contains further configuration
    information.

    If you do not have licence files for each product you will need to obtain them
    from Allinea. Trial licences may be obtained by visiting
      http://www.allinea.com/products/trials/.

    Full licences may be obtained by emailing sales@allinea.com. The licences
    should be stored in a directory called licences below the installation 
    directory. For a default (root) installation, that directory would be:
      /opt/allinea/forge/licences
    and for a user-only installation it would be:
      ${HOME}/allinea/forge/licences

2.  Running DDT
===============

    If you are using a supported desktop environment (KDE or Gnome) you
    will find a DDT icon in your Development/Programming menu.

    To run DDT from the command line, type:
        {allinea-forge-path}/bin/ddt

    or, if {allinea-forge-path}/bin is in your $PATH, just 'ddt' will do.

    You may optionally provide a program name as the first argument.

    Upon startup you will be presented with the Welcome dialog. From here you
    may choose to run a program, attach to an existing program or open a core
    file.

    To start debugging a program, click the "Run" button then in the Run window
    enter the path to your program in the Application field or use the browse
    button. Click the Run button to start the program.

    Your chosen program will be run using mpirun. If you have problems starting
    your program under DDT, first ensure it can run without DDT from the
    command line.

3.  Running MAP
===============

    If you are using a supported desktop environment (KDE or Gnome) you
    will find a MAP icon in your Development/Programming menu.

    To run MAP from the command line, type:
        {allinea-forge-path}/bin/map

    or, if {allinea-forge-path}/bin is in your $PATH, just 'map' will do.

    You may optionally provide a program name as the first argument.

    Upon startup you will be presented with the Welcome dialog. From here you
    may profile a program, or load a profile from a previous run.

    To start profiling a program, click the "Profile" button
    then in the Run window enter the path to your program in the Application
    field or use the browse button. Click the Run button to start the program.

    Your chosen program will be run using mpirun. If you have problems starting
    your program under MAP, first ensure it can run without MAP from the
    command line.
